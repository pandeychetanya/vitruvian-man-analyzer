# ‚ú® The Vitruvian Man Analyzer

*With passion by Chetanya Pandey*

Disclaimer: You're absolutely beautiful the way you're. Please don't let the AI's predictions stop you from smiling. I just tried it as a project to study 'perfect' shapes and designs, but please remember that the idea of 'perfect' is very idealistic. Having said that, I welcome you to a fascinating journey where Renaissance art meets cutting-edge AI! Do you wanna know how your pose compares to Leonardo da Vinci's iconic Vitruvian Man? Well, wonder no more! This delightful application takes your photos and reveals the hidden geometry within, measuring how closely you match the master's vision of perfect human proportions.

Imagine having a conversation with Leonardo himself about the divine mathematics of the human form - except instead of Italian, he speaks in Python and JavaScript! This project is where art history gets a high-tech makeover, combining the timeless beauty of classical proportions with the magic of modern computer vision.

## What Makes This Magical?


**The AI Artist's Eye**: The digital assistant has been trained to see human bodies the way Renaissance masters did, detecting every curve, line, and proportion with the precision of a master sculptor's chisel.

**Your Personal Proportion Prophet**: Upload any photo and watch as ancient mathematical principles come alive, revealing the hidden geometry that da Vinci believed made us perfectly human.

**A Canvas of Code**: Every analysis paints a picture of your unique proportions, creating a beautiful dance between your individuality and classical ideals.

**Interactive Wonder**: No complex software to install - just open your browser and step into a world where art and technology shake hands and create something beautiful together.

## Behind the Curtain


**The Brain** (`vitruvian_analyzer.py`): This is where all the mathematical wizardry happens! It's your Renaissance scholar who's also a computer vision expert, carefully measuring every pixel and proportion with the dedication of a monk illuminating manuscripts.

**The Heart** (`app.py`): The Flask-powered web application that serves as the welcoming host, graciously accepting your images and presenting the results with the flourish of a Renaissance court presenter.

**The Face** (Web Frontend): The beautiful interface that greets you with warm colors and intuitive design, making the complex world of proportional analysis feel as natural as sketching in a sunny Italian piazza.

### The Talented Cast of Technologies

Think of this as an artistic collaboration across centuries! I've assembled quite the ensemble:

**Python & Flask**: The steady foundation, like the marble base of Michelangelo's David, providing structure and reliability while staying elegantly simple.

**MediaPipe**: Google's gift to computer vision, acting as our digital eye that can see human poses with almost supernatural precision.

**OpenCV**: The master image craftsman, handling pixels like a Renaissance painter handles pigments.

**HTML, CSS, & JavaScript**: The trio that brings beauty to the web, creating an interface that would make da Vinci proud of how art and function dance together.

## üîç The Renaissance Detective Work

Here's where things get really exciting! Our digital detective carefully examines your photo with the same attention to detail that Leonardo used when studying human anatomy (though thankfully, much less messy than his actual dissections!).

### The Golden Measurements

Just like da Vinci had his secret notebook filled with observations about perfect proportions, our analyzer looks for these timeless relationships:

**The Head Game**: Leonardo discovered that in perfect proportions, your head should be exactly one-eighth of your total height. It's like nature's own measuring stick built right into your body!

**The Great Stretch**: Here's the famous one - when you spread your arms wide like you're giving the world the biggest hug, that span should exactly equal your height. It's geometry made human!

**The Torso Tale**: Your upper body tells its own story of proportion, creating the perfect balance between your head and your legs.

**The Foundation**: Your legs aren't just for walking - they're architectural columns that complete the divine proportion puzzle.


But wait, there's more! The analyzer also plays the role of a balance detective, checking how well your left and right sides mirror each other. It's like having a perfectionist artist ensure that both sides of a masterpiece are harmoniously aligned.

The app also sees if you fit nicely within a square (just like da Vinci's famous drawing) and finds your body's natural center point - the spot around which all your proportions dance.


All these measurements waltz together to create your personal Vitruvian score from 0 to 100. Think of it as getting a report card from Leonardo himself, with each element of your proportions contributing to the final grade. Don't worry though - this isn't about being "perfect," it's about celebrating the beautiful mathematics that make you uniquely human!
