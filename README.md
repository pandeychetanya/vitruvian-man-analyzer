# The Vitruvian Man Analyzer

*With passion by Chetanya Pandey*

Disclaimer: You're absolutely beautiful the way you're. Please don't let the AI's predictions stop you from smiling. I just tried it as a project to study 'perfect' shapes and designs, but please remember that the idea of 'perfect' is very idealistic. Having said that, I welcome you to a fascinating journey where Renaissance art meets cutting-edge AI! portions contributing to the final grade. Don't worry though - this isn't about being "perfect," it's about celebrating the beautiful mathematics that make you uniquely human!

The project examines human form through the mathematical lens of Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man, translating Renaissance ideals into computational geometry. A photograph is processed with pose-detection algorithms, extracting landmarks that allow ratios of length and symmetry to be computed. The analyzer verifies canonical proportions: the head approximating one-eighth of total height, the arm span converging to the height itself, the torso forming a balance between cranial and lower-body lengths, and the bilateral symmetry that underpins aesthetic harmony. These measurements are derived from pixel coordinates transformed into Euclidean distances, producing a quantitative mapping between individual anatomy and da Vinci’s geometric schema. In effect, the body becomes a set of vectors and ratios whose deviations from classical ideals can be precisely expressed, revealing the degree to which modern human figures align with the mathematics of Renaissance perfection.

I would like to thank the creators of MediaPipe and OpenCV for providing the tools that made pose detection and image analysis possible. Special thanks to the open-source community whose resources and examples guided the development of this project. Finally, I am inspired by Leonardo da Vinci, whose meticulous study of human proportions continues to bridge art, science, and mathematics across centuries.
